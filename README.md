Forecasting Future Consumer Price Index (CPI) Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing an accurate and reliable forecasting model for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) using advanced machine learning techniques. The CPI is a vital economic metric that tracks the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a defined basket of goods and services. Accurate CPI predictions are essential for government policymakers, businesses, economists, and individuals, as they inform decisions related to inflation management, budgeting, investment, and financial planning.

To forecast CPI values from April to November 2023, the project leverages the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network—a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for effectively modeling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies.

Model Training and Data Preparation
The LSTM model is trained on historical CPI data spanning from 2013 to April 2023. This dataset includes monthly or quarterly CPI values alongside other relevant economic and financial indicators. Prior to training, the data undergoes preprocessing to ensure consistency and integrity, including handling of missing values and outliers.

During training, the LSTM model learns the relationships between past CPI values and associated economic trends. Its internal parameters are iteratively optimized to minimize forecasting errors, thereby improving its ability to predict future values accurately.

Forecasting and Insights
Once trained and validated, the LSTM model is used to generate CPI forecasts for the period from April to November 2023. By inputting data available up to April 2023, the model predicts CPI trends for the following months. These predictions offer meaningful insights into potential inflation patterns, aiding in better decision-making for budgeting, investment planning, and price strategy formulation.

It is important to recognize that while the model demonstrates strong performance on historical data, forecast accuracy can still be influenced by unforeseen economic or geopolitical events. Therefore, continuous model updates with the latest data are crucial for maintaining performance and reliability over time.

Visualization and Storytelling with Tableau
To enhance the accessibility and interpretation of the forecasts, an interactive dashboard and storytelling module will be developed using Tableau. This dashboard will serve as a centralized visualization hub, enabling users to explore and understand the CPI forecast in an intuitive and engaging format.

Key components of the Tableau dashboard include:

Forecasted CPI Trends: Line or area charts that illustrate the projected CPI values over time, helping users identify inflation trends, patterns, and potential anomalies.
Historical Comparison: Side-by-side visual comparisons of forecasted versus actual CPI values to evaluate the model’s performance and highlight deviations.
